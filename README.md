# TheLandsOfZador
This is all the code and graphics used in "The Lands of Zador".. Use it at your own risk.. 

To run or compile it:
You need "yape.exe" somewhere in a global path
You need "dasm.exe" somewhere in a global path
You need "exomizer2.exe" somewhere in a global path

Then you can run in AsmPlus4/ScrollWorld1/test.bat to see the first level of the game

For the C part of the game you need the FLTK framework and zlib aswell as libpng.

However it may be hard to get it work. If you have questions about it just
email me at st.mader@gmx.de, let's see if I could help..

This is commited mostly for fun reasons and sincerely not a serious project here.
